# Shared_ptr

This is a self-constructed Shared_ptr class (Shared Pointer) for the purpose of practice for beginners. 

The Shared_ptr class consists of all the fundamental member functions of a typical class, including:

1. default constructor
2. constructor
3. copy constructor
4. move copy constructor
5. assignment operator
6. move assignment operator
7. destructor

Notice that the program uses "myClass" as the datatype in which each step is explicitly printed to show the user how the shared_ptr actually works behind the screen.
